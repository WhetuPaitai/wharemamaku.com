                <h2> A CAVE SILENT</h2>
                <h5 class="light"> By Whetu Paitai </h5>

                <br><br>

                 <p>Jackson Manuel tried to walk softly on the old timber floors, hoping not to wake his wife, Claire. He knew he was unsuccessful when he felt her lithe arms snake around his barrelled chest. He touched her small, soft hands and whispered…</p>
<p>“Sorry darl, I was trying not to wake you. Me and Marcus will be outta’ here in a few minutes…”</p>
<p>Claire’s hands slipped out of his and she turned him around with a gentle twist of his bearded chin. Looking into his eyes with all the fresh love that a new marriage still has, she spoke quietly.</p>
<p>“Please come home tonight honey, I sleep best when you're hogging the blankets all night…”</p>
<p>Her eyes sparkled with the same playfulness that made him fall in love with her.</p>
<p>“I will try hun, but we’ll never even make it outta' the whare if Marcus doesn’t get his get his lazy arse outta bed…”</p>
<p>The last bit he spoke loudly enough for his mate to hear. Pausing for a second, he heard a grumble and a bit of rustling from the spare room. Turning back to his wife, he whispered with a measured voice</p>
<p>“There’s only one roof I'll be sleeping under tonight my baby…” </p>
<p>With a warm kiss he smiled at her and turned to gather his gear for the days hunting.</p>

<img src="../img/flourish.png" width="50%" style="margin-bottom: 30px">

<p>The old Hilux ute pulled into the carpark of the small Four Square. Jackson tapped the fuel gauge and muttered to himself. His two mutts, Kingi and Bruce, were whining and yapping on the back of the truck, keen to get on with the day. Jackson thumped the back window.</p>
<p>“Shut it you two.”</p>
<p>Marcus piped in</p>
<p>“Mate, you chuck some gas in an I’ll go n pay… I’ll grab us some sammie’s as well, I don’t like the look of that stuff you call lunch…”</p>
<p>Jackson shrugged.</p>
<p>Noticing old Nick sitting on the bench outside the store, he gave a friendly wave. Old Nick beamed back with a great big toothless grin and called out</p>
<p>“See ya got ya lackey for the day boy. He looks… well prepared!”</p>
<p>Old Nick finished off with a cackle. Marcus looked like he had taken a fashion queue from some camping catalogue. Jackson had given him slack about it all evening. With a smile and a chuckle he headed into the store looking for his mate. </p>
<p>Marcus was loading up the counter with junk food. Jackson smiled and shook his head. Marcus had clearly spent too much time up in Auckland, growing soft, impractical and ‘towney’.</p>
<p>“We can’t take all that junk up the hill mate, besides, you won’t be hungry after the first few miles, you’ll be tired. Grab some sweets, nuts or bars.”</p>
<p>Marcus looked like he wanted to protest, but looking at his mate he nodded and sheepishly started grabbing the things off the counter. </p>
<p>George, the old store clerk, grinning at Marcus said</p>
<p>“Dun worry mate, I’ll sort this out, you listen to your old mate here, he’d be the best bushman this side of Gisborne…”</p>
<p>After paying for everything, the pair stepped outside and back into the brisk morning air. The morning birdsong was starting up and the mutts had started whining again. Jackson looked up at the dark morning sky and shook his head, muttering</p>
<p>‘Should’a been an hour up the ridge by now’ </p>

<img src="../img/flourish.png" width="50%" style="margin-bottom: 30px">

<p>The day was a waste, not a sniff of a damn thing. Maybe it was the time of the year. Maybe it was the recent rains. Maybe it was just plain old bad luck. Whatever it was, it annoyed Jackson. This ridge was usually a good bet, and he had wanted to give his mate a good run, perhaps even a go at sticking a boar. </p>
<p>To make matters worse, his two mutts had gone AWOL. Kingi he could understand, but Bruce was old now. A small part of him was worried that the old coot had got himself into trouble. The pair had been lost in the past, he thought, they’ll make their way back sometime tonight.</p>
<p>He turned to Marcus</p>
<p>“Alright mate, I think we had better head back. It just wasn’t to be…”</p>
<p>Marcus tried to look disappointed, but the relief on his face was too hard to hide. </p>
<p>“Yeah, I suppose…”</p>
<p>His body was aching. He had eaten all of his food. He was just grateful that Jackson had called it. From here on out every step was a step closer to a beer, a feed and a bed. He let himself dream for a second…</p>
<p>“We’ll cut down through this valley and work our way around to the bay until we get to the truck. Are you all good mate?”</p>
<p>Marcus snapped back to reality and nodded. He lurched after Jackson, muscles sore and stiff from the few minutes they had been standing still. Don’t stop, he noted to himself.</p>
<p>It was late afternoon and the pair had made good time moving down the ridge and into the valley. He had kept a good pace but Marcus was tiring. Smaller trek next time, Jackson thought to himself. </p>
<p>Marcus chirped up, breaking the silence that had surrounded them</p>
<p>“Hang on mate! What’s that?”</p>
<p>Marcus was pointing towards a break in the undergrowth. Jackson reluctantly stopped. Peering through the dense bush he spotted what Marcus was pointing at. It was a random pile of rocks jutting out from the matted ground cover. Jackson looked at Marcus and shrugged. Looking back at the pile he realised something was strange about the shrubs in front of the pile. The leaves were moving. </p>
<p>With interest piqued, he headed towards the pile, kicking and pulling at the vines that hung in his way. As he got closer, the pile of rocks opened up to reveal the entrance to a cave. So, this is why the leaves were moving. There was a gentle breeze coming out of the cave mouth, a cool breeze, a whining breeze…</p>
<p>“Is that…” </p>
<p>Marcus cocked his ear towards the mouth of the cave…</p>
<p>“I think that’s one of your mutts bro!”</p>
<p>Jackson was already trying to work out whether it was Kingi or Bruce. It sure sounded something like Bruce. It kinda didn’t too. </p>
<p>“I am gonna head in and check it out. If it's Bruce, he might be in trouble.”</p>
<p>Marcus shrugged his backpack off and stammered</p>
<p>“Yeah, I'll follow you in. No way I‘m gonna wait for you out here by myself. I’d get lost in a damn vegetable garden.”</p>
<p>Jackson smiled. The gear should be okay out here, this particular gully was, strangely, new to even him. </p>
<p>With nothing but a torch, the pair headed into the cave. The cool breeze dropped in temperature dramatically. Jackson pulled his Swani in tight around him as he stepped carefully through the rocks that scattered the narrow tunnel floor. Soon they were deep enough into the cave that the outside light no longer penetrated the inky blackness. </p>
<p>His Maglite torch seemed to dim as the darkness gave way to a thick silence. Jackson slowly realised that the breeze had stopped. But something else had stopped as well. Straining his ears he tried to make out any sounds. The breeze? Nope. The whining? Nope. His own breath? Even that seemed to be deathly quiet. He pressed his nose and blew out, hoping to pop his ears. No luck. In desperation, he kicked a rock towards one of the cave walls, if only to break this suffocating silence. To his horror, the rock struck the wall and fell to the floor. </p>
<p>Without making a single sound. </p>
<p>He spun around to look at Marcus. Marcus’s mouth was moving, but there was no voice. </p>
<p>“I can’t hear you!” Jackson yelled. </p>
<p>But there was no sound that left his mouth. </p>
<p>He saw Marcus’s eyes go round and wide in horror as he stumbled backward. Jackson grabbed his mates shoulder and pulled his face to his, looking piercingly into Marcus’s eyes, he mouthed a single word: </p>
<p>“Stop.” </p>
<p>Marcus shook under his firm grip, but slowly took a deep breath and nodded. </p>
<p>Jackson frantically gathered whatever coherent thoughts he had, to look for a way out of this unnatural place. Finding the tunnel they had entered from, with his dim torch, he looked at Marcus and mouthed out the words ‘Follow me’. </p>
<p>Marcus nodded. His eyes were wild.</p>
<p>Jackson held onto his mate’s shirt as he ducked into the tunnel leading back out of the cave. As he weaved through the tunnel walls he slowly began to hear his heartbeat return. Then a distant sound, the sound of air moving slowly through the cave. His footsteps were an unusually welcome sound. </p>
<p>The pair burst out of the mouth of the cave and collapsed on the ground, breathing heavily. Partly from the rush out of the cave and partly from the suffocating feeling they had just broken free from. Marcus, coughed and then snorted. He burst into a broken high pitched laugh. Jackson rolled his head over and saw tears on his friends face. Marcus was laughing out of pure adrenaline. Adrenaline mixed with fear and relief. </p>
<p>Jackson stood up after some time and started hunting for the gear they had left outside the cave. To his surprise, the gear was not where he thought they had left it. He checked in another area, but still no luck. He called out to Marcus</p>
<p>“Mate, where’d we put our gear?”</p>
<p>Marcus came over and had a quick look over the area. </p>
<p>“To be honest mate, I don't know where my mind is right now. I really just want to get out of here… Please mate…”</p>
<p>Jackson looked at Marcus and saw a pleading sincerity leaking through the manic smile that masked his face. He nodded. In truth, he too wanted nothing more than to flee this cursed place. The pair had one quick, anxious glance at the cave before heading off, away from the cave. </p>
<p>As they moved down through the bay and towards the truck, Jackson couldn’t shake an odd feeling he had. The mutts were missing, yeah, he knew that. It wasn’t the mutts. Their gear had gone missing. He had already come to terms with that. Perhaps that cave. Nope. Weird, but almost too weird to match the odd feeling he was experiencing. It was like something was just a little out. He shivered in the growing cold of the evening, and his thoughts of oddnesses dribbled away with fatigue.</p>
<p>They finally made it back to where the truck was. No Truck. Damn it. This day is just turning into a peach, Jackson thought. </p>
<p>“Okay mate, home is just a 30 minute walk away. I am tired, I can only guess that you're wrecked…” </p>
<p>He looked over to his mate, but Marcus was white with weariness. His eyes were flat with defeat. He opened his mouth to say something, a thought swept over his face, then he closed his mouth, nodded, and grunted</p>
<p>“Sweet…”</p>

<img src="../img/flourish.png" width="50%" style="margin-bottom: 30px">

<p>The two made it back to town just as it was getting too dark to see without some sort of light. </p>
<p>Jackson stopped at the store to grab a couple of six-packs. George met him at the counter, and without missing a beat he snapped </p>
<p>“Mr Manuel. You need to settle your debt.”</p>
<p>Jackson set the six-packs onto the counter and reached into his pocket to grab his wallet. Damn, he thought. He had left his wallet in his trucks glovebox. Placing two hands on the counter, he dropped his head and muttered loudly to George</p>
<p>“Mate, I haven’t got any energy for playful banter. We have had a horror day. I have lost my mutts, my truck, my hunting gear and very nearly my sanity… Can you please chuck this on the tab. I can sort ya out in the morning.” </p>
<p>“You may very well not Mr Manuel, and furthermore, there is nothing playful about this banter. I am plainly telling you that you need to settle your debt. You aren't gonna be purchasing anythin' from this store and if you leave with any unpaid goods, I will have no choice but to call Constable Hewitt. Now, can you please leave my store before I call our good friend?”</p>
<p>Jackson stood with his mouth hanging open, hands clenched on the counter and brows that were growing with fury as he slowly comprehended what George had just said to him. </p>
<p>“I don’t know who the hell you think you’re talking to George, but like I said. I've got no time for this crap. Put it on my tab. I will sort you out in the morning. You wanna call the good Constable, fine.”</p>
<p>Jackson slammed his open palm into the counter top.</p>
<p>“He knows where to find me.”</p>
<p>Jackson snatched the two six-packs and headed outside as George reached for the phone. Marcus was stomping his feet outside, on the curb, partly to keep himself warm, partly to keep himself awake. He tapped Marcus on the shoulder and motioned to him to follow. </p>
<p>As they stepped away from the store they spotted Old Nick sitting in his regular old seat. Funny, Jackson thought, this is the first time I have seen the old codger out this late! Old Nick looked at them with a scowl and slowly lifted his middle finger. </p>
<p>The old coot is being a prick too.</p>
<p>The pair made their way to Jackson’s house, but come to a standstill at the gate. The effin’ truck is in the driveway. </p>
<p>“What the hell is going on?” Jackson snorted.</p>
<p>Marcus only looked relieved that they had somehow made it home. </p>
<p>“Come on mate, let’s go in and sort this crap out…” Jackson snapped.</p>
<p>He was furious. Not at anything in particular. He had endured one of the strangest days of his life and he needed answers. But he needed answers that he knew his lovely wife would not be able to give. So with a big heaving sigh and a mental note to take it easy when he entered the house, he pressed the gate open and headed inside.</p>
<p>Claire was standing at the oven. She was always most beautiful when she was doing regular stuff. Like cooking or lounging around, watching telly. Tonight though, she looked especially beautiful. In fact, she looked stunning. This must be the day’s crappy events shining a brilliant light on the normalness of his regular life. </p>
<p>“Ah, thank God almighty” Bloody Marcus. </p>
<p>“It’s as if you could read my mi…..” Marcus broke off</p>
<p>Claire turned as a bewildered look erupted onto her face. She dropped the egg flipper into the fry pan and stepped back with a hand on her mouth. </p>
<p>Jackson stepped forward and reached out</p>
<p>“Babe…” he spoke to her softly, like to a spooked animal, not wanting to frighten her.</p>
<p>Jackson stopped dead in his tracks, as He walked around the corner. </p>
<p>It was Him. Literally, it was Him. Self.</p>
<p>The world ground to a halt as he struggled to process the image that stood in front of him. It was Jackson Manuel. Only, it wasn’t. Was this a freakin’ joke? </p>
<p>A quick glance at Claire, nope. </p>
<p>He looked closer, something was different. Everything was different. He was slimmer, He was clean shaven, and He had a scar running from the top of his cheek bone down through his top lip. But He was undeniable, Him.</p>
<p>Jackson began to hear a ringing in his ears. He could vaguely make out Marcus behind him, stammering out a collection of swear words and exclamations. Then he felt the deep silence of the cave wash over him. Then blackness.</p>

<img src="../img/flourish.png" width="50%" style="margin-bottom: 30px">

<p>“Easy big fella…” Marcus whispered.</p>
<p>Jackson had a migraine the likes of which he hadn’t felt in his life. Rubbing his temple, he flickered his eyes slightly open to find himself in his lounge, Marcus was sitting on the lounge next to him. There was a slight ringing in his ears and he could remember something about…</p>
<p>“Damn it. Marcus…”</p>
<p>Jackson looked imploringly at Marcus. Marcus slowly nodded and looked up towards the entrance of the lounge. Jackson followed his gaze and felt a lump form in his throat as his eyes came to rest on His.</p>
<p>“What the hell is going on here?” Jackson said quietly, but firmly.</p>
<p>“You tell us.” He said bluntly.</p>
<p>Jackson turned to look at Claire. She was standing defensively behind him. Jackson frowned, it broke his heart to see Claire so scared. He turned his eyes back to Him.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Jackson asked.</p>
<p>“I’m Jay. This is me home... and you won’t be askin’ the questions boy” Jay spat the last part menacingly.</p>
<p>Jackson sat up and swung his legs off the lounge in one motion. Marcus lurched to the side, but reached out and grasped Jacksons arm. Marcus shook his head urgently at Jackson and motioned towards Jay with a shake of his head. Jackson swung his eyes towards Jay and for the first time noticed the shotgun dangling to the side of him. Jackson sat up stiffly. He warily looked towards Jay and spoke with a clear low voice</p>
<p>“Listen mate, I don’t know what is going on here, but Hewitt is gonna be here any minute. George rung him after we left the store. You need to put the shotty away, mate, it won’t look a good scene to our old mate Constable.”</p>
<p>Jay took a long wary look at the pair, then stepping back, he closed the lounge door leaving the two of them alone in the room. Jackson felt Marcus’s hand drop from his arm and heard him sigh in relief. Jackson turned to Marcus and raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Yup, I agree, it is every bit as crazy as it appears mate…” Marcus quipped with his trademark smirk.</p>
<p>Jackson looked back to the lounge door, he could hear muffled whispers from outside. </p>
<p>“… and it gets even crazier mate.” Marcus said pointedly.</p>
<p>Jackson glanced back at Marcus and then down at what he was holding in his hand. It was a mug. One of those novelty ones that we all get for Christmas at some time in our lives. This one said “Worlds Greatest Housemaid”. Only, it was written backward. </p>
<p>“I don’t get it.” Jackson said with confusion.</p>
<p>“I mean what’s so funny about it being written backwards?”</p>
<p>“It’s not funny.” Marcus replied in a measured voice. </p>
<p>“It is anything but funny…”</p>
<p>Marcus handed Jackson a magazine and pointed to the front page. Jackson struggled again to make sense of what was in front of him. </p>
<p>“This is backward as well?!” Jackson snapped at his friend. </p>
<p>“I don’t know what point you’re trying to prove Marcus. What are you getting at?”</p>
<p>Marcus made a sweeping gesture around the room and then looked back to Jackson with one raised eyebrow. Jackson began to get wild with his friends roundabout way of making a point. He was about to snap when it struck him. And it struck him like a freight train. This was what had made him feel uneasy. This was what had been setting him on edge.</p>
<p>Everything was backwards!</p>
<p>He swayed in the lounge as his mind took in this simple but staggering fact. This lounge of his, it was backwards. The door was on the right of the room. It should be on the left. This House was backwards. The entry door should have been down the drive on the right side of the building. It was on the left. The friggin main street was backward! The store was on the right side of the road. Should be Left. Hell. The whole bay and, Jackson thought to himself, the whole world!</p>
<p>“What the hell is this Marcus? What sort of cockamamie bull crap are you pulling here? This isn’t bloody funny.”</p>
<p>Marcus shook his head at Jackson. </p>
<p>“Mate, this aint no joke. That’s a real gun he had. That aint funny to me.”</p>
<p>Marcus leant in and whispered frantically</p>
<p>“What are we gonna tell them? If we try telling them the truth they will think we are loopy. He’ll probably shoot us to put us out of our misery. Shit Jackson. What are we gonna do?”</p>
<p>Jackson looked back around the room. He was still a little bit in shock, but brought himself to check and pieced a half arsed plan together. </p>
<p>“Alright. We can just play along with whatever games they wanna play, then in the morning we will head back to the cave and walk through it again. I figure, it was the thing that got us to this god-forsaken place, it can get us back.” </p>
<p>Jackson glanced across at Marcus. Marcus returned his look with a doubtful frown.</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah. I don’t like it one bit either but there we have it. If you have a better idea, then be my friggin guest…” Jackson snapped.</p>
<p>Marcus never had a chance.</p>
<p>They heard some loud talking outside the door, then without warning it swung open. In the entrance stood Constable Hewitt with Jay’s shotgun. Everything backwards. </p>
<p>“Evening Constable” Jackson said.</p>
<p>“Bloody hell Jay, you’re not kidding alright.” The Constable blurted out with no constraint.</p>
<p>“Sorry boys. You will have to forgive the shock. I am sure you understand. My name is Constable…”</p>
<p>“Hewitt…” Jackson interrupted.</p>
<p>“We know.”</p>
<p>“Well, well.” Replied the Constable, with a look of slight irritation on his face.</p>
<p>“That is a little disconcerting, because I do not know who you two are. Except for the fact that you appear to be trying to pass yourselves off as ol’ Jay here. Which I might add, is probably not the best move in this particular town…” </p>
<p>The Constable threw a condescending glance towards Jay, which received its due grumble.</p>
<p>Jackson took a deep breath</p>
<p>“Look, Constable, we have been hunting over the last week and managed to get ourselves lost. We also lost all of our gear, including my mutts, truck and way. It appears that we may have upset some of the people in this town, but we have no intention of doing so and come the morning, me and my mate will be on our way…” </p>
<p>“Like bloody hell you will be. Give me a sec…” snapped the Constable.</p>
<p>Jackson watched as the Constable took in what he had said. With a small nod he turned to Jay and said</p>
<p>“Okay Jay, your turn to give something back to this town that you have caused so much grief to. I haven’t got time to deal with this, there’s a serious crash down on State Highway 2 and I need to cover the crash site. I am going to leave…”</p>
<p>The constable turned to Jackson</p>
<p>“Phillip…” Jackson said. He hoped Marcus would get the hint.</p>
<p>“John…” Marcus said. Thank God.</p>
<p>“I am going to leave Phillip and John in your care for the night. We will sort this out in the morning. You two…” The constable turned to the pair.</p>
<p>“Do not leave this house. Or you will be arrested.” </p>
<p>Jackson and Marcus nodded sincerely.</p>
<p>Turning back to Jay, the Constable levelled his voice</p>
<p>“And Jay. Don’t eff this up.”</p>
<p>Jay mumbled under his breath. He was sullen, but appeared much more settled than earlier. </p>
<p>“Alright folks, I will be back here at 6am sharp. It will be the end of my shift so no bloody shenanigans. Get some sleep and make sure you are up in the morning. 6. A. M. Sharp. Got it?”</p>
<p>Everyone nodded. </p>
<p>The Constable tipped his head towards Claire</p>
<p>“Evening ma’am.”</p>
<p>Claire nodded back with that lovely smile of hers.</p>
<p>With that the Constable turned and disappeared from the doorway.</p>
<p>Jay moved into the doorway with a scowl on his face. </p>
<p>“The only reason the two of you clowns are staying here the night is because I am on a good behaviour bond. Either of ya do something stupid and I will be takin me return trip home… On the account of slittin' your damn throats.” </p>
<p>Jay stood for a moment to let the last part of his sentence sink in. It was a bit melodramatic for Jacksons taste, but he played along.</p>
<p>“Okay mate, we dun want no trouble. We are wickedly hungry though, and we brought some drinks with us… Any chance?” Jackson looked at Jay with his best impersonation of a frightened animal.</p>
<p>“Claire can fix up something. As for the drinks, I gave em’ to the Constable, you can sort ‘at out for ya damn selves in the mornin'.” </p>
<p>With that Jay turned and stalked out of the room, closing the door behind him.</p>
<p>There was a knock on the door about half an hour later and Claire walked in with two plates of steaming hot mince and four slices of thick toasted brown bread with butter. She placed the two plates on the coffee table, gave a quick smile towards Jackson and then turned and walked out of the room, closing the door behind her. </p>
<p>Marcus snatched his plate up with no regard to Claire. Jackson on the other hand stared at the space she had just left. He remembered his promise to his wife and cursed himself for not making it home that night. Next time he wouldn’t promise. He hated disappointing her. </p>
<p>“Just remember, that ain’t ya wife mate…” Marcus jibed.</p>
<p>Good. Marcus was feeling himself again. Jackson wondered if he was being unfaithful by thinking other Claire was beautiful. He passed it off as too complicated for any normal man to contemplate and reasoned that his Claire would understand. It was just the way she was. Grabbing his plate he slowly began devouring his plate of mince and toast.</p>
<p>Jay came in as they were finishing up their supper. He dumped a couple of old ragged blankets on the ground, took the two empty plates and left the room again. He returned a few minutes later with two cups of hot tea, placing them on the coffee table. Standing upright, he turned to face the pair and threw an empty milk bottle at them. </p>
<p>“It’s 9 o’clock. It gets cold out here. Drink your tea and get some sleep. I will have ya both up aroun’ 5am. You can piss in that bottle. If I hear either of ya leave this room tonight, there will be no 5am wake up…” More melodrama. “…Don’t test me.”</p>
<p>With that, Jay turned and left the room for the final time that night. He heard a lock click on the door. Great. Now they were prisoners. </p>
<p>Marcus grabbed a blanket and a cup of tea and lay back on one of the lounges and speaking in a calm voice said </p>
<p>“Well, this could be a lot worse my friend…” </p>
<p>“How?” Jackson said in his mind. But he didn’t want to say it out loud. No jynx.</p>
<p>He leant over and grabbed his tea and blanket and settled himself down on the other lounge.</p>
<p>“So, I don’t really get it.” Jackson broke the silence after a minute of quietly sipping his tea.</p>
<p>“Is this a different world? Like, the same world, but a duplicate? A duplicate that is backwards?”</p>
<p>Saying it out loud made it sound even more far-fetched. </p>
<p>“I think it is more like another dimension.” Marcus replied.</p>
<p>“Like off a movie or something. Not everything is different. For instance, everyone still talks the same way. Walking forwards is still walking forwards and walking backwards is still walking backwards, up is still up and down is st…” </p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah mate. Please, make your point for once…” Jackson interrupted with a crooked smile. </p>
<p>Marcus seemed too lost in thought to mind.</p>
<p>“Well, it seems that the only thing that is backwards is left and right. Kinda like when you look in a mirror I suppose.” Marcus finished.</p>
<p>“But it isn’t just the world that is backwards. The people are slightly… off. Jay looks like me, but effed if I know who he is. Same with the Constable, George down at the store, Old Nick… Heck everyone is slightly different. Even Claire…” Jackson tailed off.</p>
<p>“That is not the same Claire mate.” This time Marcus was a little more serious.</p>
<p>Jackson snapped back into focus.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know. She is… something though, right?” Jackson looked towards Marcus.</p>
<p>Marcus spoke in an even tone. </p>
<p>“She is not your wife.”</p>
<p>Jackson nodded, feeling a little sheepish. Marcus noticed and piped in to try to change the topic.</p>
<p>“You think this world and ours is linked?” </p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Jackson replied</p>
<p>Finishing his tea, Marcus placed it back on the table and tucked himself back into the blanket on the lounge.</p>
<p>“Well, do you think that things in this world affect things in ours?”</p>
<p>Jackson returned Marcus a look of confusion.</p>
<p>“For instance,” Marcus clarified “if you are a cool dude in our world, which you aren’t, would that mean, by definition, that the you in this world is a prick?”</p>
<p>“It would seem that way” Replied Jackson with a smirk.</p>
<p>“Where are you going with this?”</p>
<p>”Nowhere really, just wondering how screwed up all this crap is…” Marcus trailed off.</p>
<p>"It's screwed up alright." Jackson shot back.</p> 
<p>"I tell ya this much, if <em>anyone</em> treated <em>my</em> Claire like that, I would snap their necks." He felt his fury rise in him, before shaking his head clear.</p>
<p>"You reckon it'd be considered suicide if I snapped <em>his</em> neck?</p>
<p>Nothing. Jackson glanced back towards Marcus. He had drifted off to sleep. </p>
<p>"Ol Mr Cuppa Tea Tough Guy here..." Jackson muttered to himself.</p>
<p>"Your right mate, get some sleep, it'll be all over tomorrow mornin."</p>
<p>Jackson was surprised Marcus had lasted this long. He would have to wake him up around 4am if they were to break out of here and make their way back to the cave by dawn. He set his watch alarm to 4am and settled back into the lounge with his hot drink. It had been a long day for him too, and it felt like the day had finally caught up. His eyes felt heavy and his gut felt full. </p>
<p>The last thing he felt as he drifted off to sleep was the hot burning sensation of his hot tea spilling down his chest…</p>

<img src="../img/flourish.png" width="50%" style="margin-bottom: 30px">

<p>Jackson was startled awake by muffled sounds somewhere in the room. He felt cold and wet, and his head was as groggy as after a big night out. Where the hell was he? He frantically searched his mind for some answer. Like thunder, the memories of the previous day’s events burst back into his consciousness. </p>
<p>Jackson quickly realised the muffled sounds had stopped, and he heard some light footsteps shuffling towards him. His senses exploded inside him. Everything felt alive in a single instant, his heart pounded in his chest and without thinking he reacted. Jackson swung his fist wildly up at where he imagined the threat to be. He heard a cracking thud, but it felt like he hadn’t hit a thing. He suddenly realised that he had the broken handle of the mug in his hand. Rolling off the lounge, he turned to face the direction of the thing he had struck. He heard some groaning. Whoever it was, they were down. Jackson staggered to his feet and stumbled towards the door. </p>
<p>“What the hell? Where is the door?” Jackson thought. </p>
<p>Then he remembered. Hoping that he would be wrong, he stumbled to the right, feeling along the wall. He felt the door that was in a place it shouldn’t have been and frantically searched for the light switch. Once he had found it he smashed the switch plate with his hand until the light flickered on. </p>
<p>Turning around he surveyed the scene with horror. There was blood everywhere. He shot a glance towards the other lounge that his mate was sleeping on and nearly choked in grief. Draped over the lounge and dangling down onto the floor was the limp body of his best mate Marcus. Blood leaked from his body like it does when you bleed the carcass of an animal. He turned back towards the groaning shape on the floor, and his fury flared up as he realised that it was him. </p>
<p>It was Jay. </p>
<p>Jackson moved in two strides and booted the knife that Jay held feebly up towards him. He placed one foot on either side of Jay’s ribcage and then dropped his knees onto Jay’s shoulders, pinning Jay to the floor. Placing his hands around Jay’s throat he began to squeeze. Even when the face pleaded with him and mouthed the word “please”, he continued to squeeze. That scar, that scowl, that clean shaven skin, that scruffy hair, that face that looked back at him was one that he hated. That face was his, and he hated it with all his heart. Jackson squeezed until hot tears poured down his face and dripped on the frozen face of the dead man he had between his hands. </p>
<p>He rolled off Jay and reluctantly crawled towards the body of his friend. He didn’t want to find out the truth, but he knew before he even reached the body. He sobbed at the body for some time and then he lifted the body of his friend up onto the couch. He put his hands over his friends open eyes, apologised to him for getting him into this mess, and then closed them for the last time. </p>
<p>Standing up he walked over to Jay’s body and picked up his knife and plunged it into his chest, partly to ensure he was dead, partly to give one final insult to the body of the man who had stolen his best mate from him. Pulling the knife out with a jerk, Jackson stood and surveyed the scene one final time before stumbling towards the door.</p>
<p> Claire shouldn’t have been standing behind the door like she was. He didn’t mean to press the knife so quickly. He was still in heavy shock from the struggle with Jay. His body reacted with a reflex that was impossible to stop. Jackson caught Claire as she fell away from the knife that was in her chest and heard himself saying</p>
<p>“No, no, no, dear God no…” </p>
<p>As he lowered her gently down, she lifted her hand up and stroked the beard on the side of his face. </p>
<p>“Jay… He drugged you… with the drink I think. He was just going to rob you and dump you guys out of town. But then last night he suddenly…” </p>
<p>She coughed up some blood. </p>
<p>“…suddenly decided he was going to kill you… I have been pleading with him all night. He asked me to kill you, but I told him I could never kill you… Not you…” </p>
<p>Claire looked up in to his eyes forlornly.</p>
<p>”…you seem like the person I wanted to lov…” Claire took a few last quick breaths and then with one last sigh breathed her last. </p>
<p>Jackson felt something inside him break. He was fairly certain it was his heart. He sat in that doorway for a long time, sobbing as he held Claire in his arms. He cried until he had no more emotions left inside of him. When he finally let the lifeless body of this dear Claire go, he was wasted, emotionally, physically and mentally. He staggered towards the front door and stepped outside.</p>
<p>The icy cold of the morning air struck him deep inside his body. It jolted his brain back into action. He looked around lurched towards the parked truck in the drive. The driver’s seat was on the opposite side. Of course it was. It was unlocked, keys in the sun shade. So typical. So not him. He jammed the keys in the ignition and backed the truck out of the drive. He had to consciously remind himself to drive on the wrong side of the road, hoping that this wasn’t one of those exceptions. </p>
<p>As he drove past the store he noticed a car heading towards him on the opposite side of the road. He was thankful that for once, this world had operated as he had predicted. He was less thankful when he saw whose car it was. Constable Hewitt. He must be headed to the house. Damn. </p>
<p>Jackson waited until he was out of town and then pressed his foot down on the accelerator. He raced towards the bay and the entrance to the valley with the cave. He looked back towards the town as it drifted out of sight and could see the blue and red flash of the Constables patrol car. He was already in pursuit. </p>
<p>Jackson arrived at the entrance to the valley and jumped out of the ute. He could hear the patrol car, it was close. He bolted into the under growth and then into the tree line just as the blue and red lights of the Constables vehicle came into view. He knew that Hewitt had seen him at the edge of the bush, he had to move fast. Jackson crashed through the thickening bush towards the base of the valley that had the cave. He could hear Hewitt yelling out for him to give up peacefully. </p>
<p>He headed up the valley and staggered into the clearing that had the small cave, framed by rocks. He hadn’t noticed the first time, but the rocks were man made. They had been stacked to look natural, but the had some kind of writing chiseled into them and the rocks were perfectly keyed into one another. This doesn’t happen naturally. </p>
<p>“Freeze! Stop moving!” the Constable screamed.</p>
<p>Jackson dove into the cave, following the breeze that was still blowing into the cave mouth. He was sure he heard the ring of bullets ricocheting off the stone entrance, but he didn’t stop to find out. The tunnel got darker and darker until he was moving by touch alone. He suddenly felt the cave tunnel walls widen and the deep, suffocating silence, that had terrified him and Marcus the day before, roll over him like a blanket. But still, he pressed on. Jackson broke into full stride, tearing into the complete silence and darkness. </p>
<p>He didn’t realise what had happened until he tasted the blood on his tongue and the earth under his hands. He was sitting on the ground. Confused he put his hands out in front of him and felt a wall, a rock wall. He had run face first into the wall. But something was strange about this wall… it was… It was… moving! Jackson jerked his hand back as he felt tendrils of rock begin to wrap themselves around his fingers. Pushing himself up off the earth floor, he stumbled backwards and away from the moving wall. </p>
<p>In the distance he could see a sliver of light flickering about. It was the Constable, he was sure. Realising how utterly lost he was in this deep, inky blackness, he made a break towards the light and certain confrontation. As he neared the light he could make out the Constable. He looked like he was in complete shock, mouthing out words to himself. He shook his head and started looking around the cavern. </p>
<p>Jackson continued to stagger past the Constable, stumbling into the empty tunnel entrance. Glancing back, he saw the Constable drop to the ground and his torch fall in a slow motion spin, striking the ground and flickering out in two short bursts. Jackson continued on through the tunnel, first his heartbeat coming back, then the sound of the breeze and finally, thankfully, the sound of his stumbling footsteps on the cave floor. He saw the bright light of the morning sun streak into the cave entrance and made a bolt out into the cold morning air. </p>
<p>Collapsing to the ground just outside the cave mouth, Jackson sucked in deep breaths and looked up at the morning light filtering through the dancing leaves in the trees. He looked curiously at the leaves on the ground. They were blowing out from the cave mouth. Funny he thought, it is as if that world is blowing a breeze into this world. </p>
<p>A powerful weariness overtook him, but he knew he had to keep moving. He had to find out if he was home again. He had to hold his Claire in his arms again. </p>
<p>Standing to wobbly feet, Jackson staggered down through the valley, leaning and falling from tree to tree. Making it to the edge of the forest, he saw his truck parked at the edge of the under growth. He looked around for the Constables patrol car. Nope. Approaching the truck he looked inside, this was definitely his own truck. He opened the truck and climbed inside as a strong wave of relief flooded over him. </p>
<p>As he drove away, heading towards home, he cried great heaving sobs into one of his arms. Everything looked welcoming in this world, everything wanted him to be here, everything said to him that he was home. </p>
<p>The roads were the right way around. </p>
<p>The store was where it was meant to be. </p>
<p>Old Nick flashed a toothy grin and raised all five fingers in a wave towards Jackson… </p>
<p>…Jackson nearly broke down at this gesture. </p>
<p>Jackson pulled his truck into a home that was the right way around and after taking a few moments to collect himself, he wearily crawled out of the truck and climbed the steps to his front door. Holding his breath he gently opened the door and stepped back into his home. Edging to the kitchen doorway, he heard the sound of something frying and turning the corner, he could not have seen a more beautiful sight. His Claire. Beautiful, doing regular stuff. </p>
<p>Claire turned in surprise, a smile erupted on her face.</p>
<p>“Oh, why hello stranger!” She smirked. So beautiful.</p>
<p>“You very selfishly let me have all the blankets last night ya know…” </p>
<p>Jackson tried desperately to hold his tears in. Rubbing his eyes with the back of his dirty, bloody sleeve, he murmured </p>
<p>“Yeah well, you know, I am always thinking about myself like that…” with a small grin.</p>
<p>“You look terrible, but it looks like you got something. Where’s marcus?” She asked.</p>
<p>Jackson was startled, he didn’t think this far ahead.</p>
<p>“Well, uhh, we did get a small boar, but cause we stayed over night Marcus had to catch the bus earlier this morning back to Aucks… An we left the pig with one of the farmers back up the valley…” He stammered…</p>
<p>Claire paused for a sec and gave him an odd look. </p>
<p>“Oh well… whatever, go get yourself washed up, breakfast is almost ready.” </p>
<p>Jackson sensed a slight irritation in Claire’s voice. Best just give it some time he thought to himself. He had a long hot shower and scrubbed all the blood from his body. He thought about how some of the blood that was on him was Claire’s and how strange that fact was. </p>
<p>After breakfast Jackson crawled into his bed. He was completely wrecked. Claire brought him a hot cup of tea and sitting on the edge of the bed she stirred the cup while he stroked her back. He would have to explain the disappearance of Marcus, the blood on his clothes, and his missing mutts at some stage. But for now he was just happy to be somewhere normal. Reaching across he pulled on her arm to try to coax a cuddle out of her. She gave him the cup with a sly smile. Careful, Jackson said to himself, she is probably still annoyed that ya didn't make it home last night. Taking the cup, he backed off and let Claire have her space. She got up and after adjusting their wedding photo on the bedside table, she left the room saying</p>
<p>“Get some sleep hun, you have a lot to explain when you wake…”</p>
<p>Jackson nodded and sipping on his tea, he thought to himself, it won’t be easy brushing over this one. </p>
<p>He began thinking of his friend Marcus and he quietly shed some tears for his best mate. He thought of the other Claire, and shed some more tears. His mind drifted to the strangeness of the day, and the discovery of another world. He felt the sensation of burning tea on his chest again. He thought to himself that this was strangely familiar. Rolling over he dropped the mug onto the bedside table and watched with detached amusement as it toppled off, taking the wedding photo with it. The last thing Jackson saw before his eyes closed was a small, white pill bottle, and sliding into an uncontrollable slumber he faintly remembered something the other Claire had said… </p>
<p>Maybe Marcus was right.</p>

<p>KUA MUTU</p>
