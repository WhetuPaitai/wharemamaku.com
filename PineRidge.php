                <h2> PINE RIDGE</h2>
                <h5 class="light"> By T A McPherson </h5>

                <br><br>

                <p>The wild boar squealed high and long. Jamie Prince grabbed its hind legs and lifted them in the air. Django, a massive white and brown bull mastiff, was holding tight to the boar's right ear, while Bitch, a black labrador, bounced around barking. When Jamie flipped the boar onto its back it stopped squealing. It grunted deep and snapped a few times at Django, but the dog was smart enough to stay out of the way. The boar had already opened a gash above the dog's eyes with its sharp tusks and blood had seeped down giving the white dog a red-brown bandits mask. Jamie stuck his knee into the boar and pulled his knife out of its sheath. He patted the boar on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;Good fight mate, good fight.&quot; He told the boar.</p>
<p>He stuck the pointed blade into the soft spot below the boar's throat, straight towards the heart. The knife severed an artery and the boar arched its back and then dropped limp, as warm blood spurted out of the wound and over Jamie's hand. He waited until the blood stopped pumping out with the boar's dying heart beat and withdrew the knife. He placed the knife back in its sheath without cleaning it, an old hunters' tradition. He supposed it still held DNA from the first boar he'd stuck all those years ago as a teenager. Django let go of the boar's ear and let out a few victory barks. Jamie gave him a pat and then checked over his injuries.</p>
<p>&quot;Just a scratch, boy, you'll live&quot; He said.</p>
<p>The dog responded by licking his face.</p>
<p>Jamie checked over Bitch, who had no injuries. Being a bailer, she rarely got close enough to the boar to get hurt. Clever girl, he thought, as he gave her a pat.</p>
<p>Once the dogs were checked over, he looked around. They were in a dried up creek in the bottom of a deep, bush dense gully. Jamie hadn't been into this gully before, as he normally walked around it over Pine Ridge. He turned to the boar, steam rising off its corpse in the cool winter afternoon. It was about 130 pounds, he assumed, a big un'. The boar's tusk was going to look good hanging in his &quot;man cave&quot; and the meat would fill the freezer, but he didn't relish the thought of the two hour trek back to his truck. The dogs had chased this boar a long way.</p>
<p>&quot;I should've brought the boy.&quot; He said aloud, to no one in particular.</p>
<p>His twelve year old son, Hemi, was mad on hunting. But the boy looked so peacefully asleep this morning that Jamie thought he'd let him sleep in; he'd had a big week. By now the boy would've assumed that he'd caught a boar and was probably waiting on his quad bike for him at the truck.</p>
<p>Jamie dug his pocket knife out of his pack and began to gut the boar. His dogs lay nearby panting, tired from the hunt. A curious fantail flitted around watching him as he worked. He pulled the innards, still steaming hot, from the hole he had cut in the boars belly. He threw the heart, liver, kidneys and testicles to the dogs, a reward for their hard work.</p>
<p>The fantail was joined by another, they both hopped around the branches and shrubs watching Jamie. Brave little birds. Sometimes they hopped close enough that Jamie could have reached out and grabbed one, if he were fast enough.</p>
<p>He thought about these strange birds and the others, the ones that had recently changed migratory patterns, baffling ornithologists. Hundreds of thousands of birds had descended on cities and towns around the world, anywhere that humans congregated. The birds caused havoc everywhere, fouling water supplies and ruining vehicles and metal structures with acidic faeces. Men in hazard suits roamed the larger cities with giant mega phones that screeched at the birds herding, them away, but they always came back. Living rurally meant that Jamie and his family had escaped the problems experienced by those living in the cities, but they had marvelled at the spectacle of flocks of migrating birds, a multitude of species, decorating the sky.</p>
<p>The scientists and commentators on the news shows had differing theories on what was the cause of this phenomenon. Some blamed man-made climate change, others an unknown avian virus and some even thought this may be a precursor to the changing of the poles. But they all agreed on one thing, that they didn't really know. One American church leader blamed the gay loving government for bringing God's wrath upon mankind. Jamie was a God fearing man, but he thought that, somehow, God had better things to worry about. He hadn't worried himself too much about it either, his family was safe and his sheep farm wasn't affected. He had even stopped watching the news a few days ago, too depressing, something about missing people.</p>
<p>With the boar hog tied and ready to go, Jamie sat down for a mug of tea from his thermos. It was an overcast day, but he knew he had at least five hours of daylight left. No rush, he thought. The sweet tea was particularly satisfying after walking so far to catch such a big beast, like sliding into a spa pool, he thought. Not far away Django was still chewing on a testicle, he'd smell like boar all week, Jamie knew. Bitch was sniffing around and began walking up the gully, stopping every few metres to sniff at the wind.</p>
<p>&quot;Easy girl,&quot; Jamie called, &quot;This one's enough.&quot;</p>
<p>Bitch trotted back to him, whining.</p>
<p>Jamie stretched out his aching muscles, I better get moving before I cramp up, he thought. Just then a crack opened in the clouds and the sun shone down on them. In a minute, he thought, draining his mug and lying back on rotting leaves and twigs, enjoying the suns warmth.</p>
<p>In a minute. </p>
<p>When he woke, he was cold and he knew immediately that he only had a few hours of daylight left. He sat up and looked around cursing himself. His legs had cramped up and he had to stretch his back out, he clicked and creaked like an old house. The dogs were fast asleep and a few flies had settled on the carcass of the dead boar. To his right a movement caught his eye. He looked and was surprised to see a young girl standing in the bush twenty metres above him. Her face was dirty and scratched and it was framed by a mess of tangled black hair. She was wearing what Jamie assumed used to be pink flowery pyjamas. They were now so covered in dirt and rips it was hard to tell. She looked down at Jamie with blank, dark brown eyes, swaying slightly.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello&quot; Jamie called out, unsure of what to say.</p>
<p>Django and Bitch woke and lifted their heads, bitch let out a little bark at the girl.</p>
<p>&quot;Easy girl&quot; Said Jamie.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you been lost?&quot; he called to the girl.</p>
<p>She said nothing, just stared.</p>
<p>&quot;I can help you. I can take you home - are you hungry?&quot;</p>
<p>Jamie reached into his pack, pulled out some biscuits and waved them at the girl.</p>
<p>&quot;Here&quot; he said, &quot;Bikkies.&quot;</p>
<p>The girl stared at the biscuits and a look of recognition crossed her face, she looked at the dogs and then back at Jamie and looked as if she were about to cry. Then a fantail flitted past her and her blank stare returned. She turned slowly and began to walk away.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait!&quot; Jamie called after her.</p>
<p>He pulled himself up off the ground and began to follow her up the hill. His leg was cramped and he had to stretch it out as he climbed. He could see the girl through the trees and she was getting away from him, fantails in tow.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait!&quot; he called again.</p>
<p>He began a limping jog up the hill, cursing the trees and supplejack vines in his way. He tracked the girl for almost an hour, but in the end he had to accept that he had lost her. He had kept the dogs at heel, worried they might scare her. He made his way back down the gully to the boar and his pack.</p>
<p>He had to decide what to do, if he trekked out, he'd be home an hour or two after dark. He had a torch and he knew these hills well, but by the time he raised the alarm the girl could be long gone, lost deeper in the forest, or worse, dead.</p>
<p>&quot;What to do? What to do?&quot; he asked Django, &quot;I think we're in for a long night, boy.&quot;</p>
<p>Django wagged his tail.</p>
<p>Jamie pulled out his old cell phone, 'The Brick', Hemi had called it. No signal. He packed the phone, his thermos and biscuits back into his pack. He cut the bottom jaw off the boar, his trophy, and a back leg, for dinner, and strapped them to his pack. He set off back up the hill, heading towards the top of Pine Ridge. He made it to the top quite fast, the cramp had faded from his legs and the adrenaline of the situation pushed him onward.</p>
<p>He reached the top about the same time the sun began casting an orange and purple net across the cloudy horizon. He pulled 'The Brick' cell phone out and held it in the air. He saw one bar of reception, blinking on and off. Not enough to make a phone call he knew, instead he wrote a text to his wife:</p>
<p>Honey saw girl age </p>
<p>8 or 9 in bush. Lost.</p>
<p>Going to look 4 her.</p>
<p>Call police.</p>
<p>First saw 4th gully</p>
<p>Nth side, Pine ridge.</p>
<p>Love you, see you</p>
<p>2moro. </p>
<p>Short and sweet, he thought. He held the cell phone back in the air and hit send. A small circle began to spin on the screen, Sending, it said and then after a minute of spinning, SENT.</p>
<p>A shepherds whistle hung around his neck, tucked under his t-shirt, warm against his skin. He pulled it out and let out a long whistle, hoping the girl would hear and come back to him. He whistled a long and loud, over and over until he became dizzy with breathlessness. The dogs were agitated by the whistle, whining and pacing. He rested for a few minutes and then began to shout.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm here! Up the Hill! I'm Here! Here, here, here! Up the hill!&quot;</p>
<p>He kept this up, rotating between shouts and whistles, until his throat was raw and his head was spinning. The sun had set in full and the orange and purple was fading. Less than a half hour of daylight left. He walked along the top of the ridge looking for an open area to build a fire. It would be cold and windy, but he needed to be up high if the girl were to see his night fire. He just hoped it wouldn't rain. He found an open spot five minutes along the ridge. A rocky outcrop protruded up from the ground providing a natural shelter. He hurried to collect wood to make a fire, aware of the fading light. By the time he was finished it was past dusk and the stars were beginning to wake around a dull crescent moon in the sky. No clouds, he thought, thankful. He struck a match and tried to light the fire with shaky fingers. The match dropped and flickered out. He held up his hands in front of his face, they were calloused and rough, like pumice. His wife said she liked them, they made her feel safe, he smiled thinking about that, the lovely lies they told each other. Right now the hands she loved were shaking. Whether from cold, fatigue or fear he wasn't sure. He had another go at lighting a match, gripping tight this time. The flame flickered and then took. He held it under the dry tinder he'd scraped off of a manuka tree. It caught quickly and before night fell in full the fire was burning high and bright, so hot that sweat poured down his dirty face.</p>
<p>He skewered the pork leg on a sharpened stick and stuck one end of the stick into the ground so that the meat hung close to the flame. The smell of burnt hair filled the air. He settled down in the warmth, fiddled with his small shortwave radio until Elvis began crooning at him and then poured himself a cup of tea. Still hot. It was a good thermos, a birthday present from Hemi. He threw a few biscuits to his dogs and then finished the packet with his tea.</p>
<p>I should've saved some, he thought, for the girl.</p>
<p>He found a muesli bar in his pack and made note to save it for her.</p>
<p>As the pork leg cooked he rotated the stick and scraped the singed fur from the skin with his pocket knife. He sliced off some large pieces and tossed them to the dogs, then let the leg cook some more. The smell was tantalising, it was a fat boar and the pork sizzled and spat in the fire. If the beacon light didn't bring the girl in, the smell of hot meat would, certainly.</p>
<p>After he'd eaten his full he broke the leg into two bits from the trotter and shared the leftovers with his dogs. He turned off the radio and then settled down as close as he could handle to the fire and stared around at the dark forest. To the east, about 5 kilometres, was a stretch of darkness that he knew was the sea and far to the north the lights of a town highlighted the horizon.</p>
<p>A place plagued by birds and here sit I, he thought.</p>
<p>He gazed up at the sky and wondered about the strangeness of the girl he'd seen in the gully below. The one who'd just walked away. He was in the middle of nowhere; his nearest neighbour lived a three quarter of an hour's drive away. What was she doing there? For the first time he allowed himself to wonder if he had dreamt it - he had fallen asleep. He thought about the police, who were surely assembling the Search and Rescue teams as he lay there. If it turned out to be a day dream he'd be the laughing stock of the rugby club. Not that he cared too much about what people thought of him. He had seen the girl, he decided. Bitch had barked at her.</p>
<p>&quot;You saw her, didn't you Bitch?&quot; he asked her. She stood up and walked to him, wagging her tail. She lay next to him with her head on his stomach.</p>
<p>&quot;You did&quot; he said, patting her on the head, &quot;you did.&quot;</p>
<p>Django grizzled in his sleep. The fire crackled. A morepork hooted in the distance. Jamie pulled his swandri tight around his chest and fell asleep.</p>
<p>Something woke him. He had an uneasy feeling in his stomach, something had woken him. The fire had burned down and he was cold, even with the swandri. It was dark, the stars and crescent moon had been swallowed by clouds. The only light came from the dying embers of his fire. He hit the light button on his watch and the blue light hurt his eyes. 3:07 am. Three more hours till dawn.</p>
<p>&quot;Django, Bitch&quot; he whispered.</p>
<p>The dogs weren't there.</p>
<p>Probably off hunting, I should've tied them up, he thought, Dammit.</p>
<p>He dug through his bag for his mini-mag light and squinted when he hit the switch. He gave his eyes time to adjust and then swung the torch beam around his campsite. No dogs.</p>
<p>He suddenly realised what made him feel uneasy - and probably what woke him up. A tui was whistling every few minutes, off in the distance, and getting closer. He checked his watch again. 3:13 am. Three more hours till dawn. Why was a tui whistling at night? The realisation made the hair prickle on his neck. He swung the torch around at the trees that surrounded the open clearing. Nothing. He called out again.</p>
<p>&quot;Django! Bitch!&quot; Loud this time. He followed this with a sharp whistle, two distinct notes, his special whistle, just for his dogs. Much closer this time the tui copied his whistle, three times, a high pitched note followed by a note a few tones lower. He swung the torch around and it landed on the face of the girl, standing between two shrubs, staring at him. Smiling. He just about dropped the torch and sucked in his breath. Heart pounding.</p>
<p>&quot;Shit!&quot; He said, forgetting himself, &quot;You scared the living daylights out of me&quot;</p>
<p>The girl said nothing. He stood up and took a step towards the girl.</p>
<p>&quot;It's O.K darling, I won't hurt you, I stayed here so I can help. The police are looking for you and will come and get you as soon as the sun rises.&quot;</p>
<p>The girl took a step back and then a step forward. She stuck out her hand, palm up and hooted at him. Like an owl.</p>
<p>Jamie thought he understood.</p>
<p>&quot;You want the biscuits?&quot;</p>
<p>The girl stuck her hand out further and hooted again.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry, I was being a pig and I accidentally ate them all.&quot;</p>
<p>The girl's eyes flashed with anger. Deep, adult anger.</p>
<p>&quot;It's O.K, it's O.K.&quot; Jamie said, putting his hands up in mock surrender. &quot;I've got something else.&quot;</p>
<p>He walked backwards slowly to his pack, his hands still up. He reached a hand down and pulled the muesli bar from the top of the pack.</p>
<p>&quot;Here, catch&quot; he said, tossing it to her.</p>
<p>She caught it and then stepped back into the bush, without taking her eyes off Jamie.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait&quot; He called, starting forward. But then he stopped suddenly, because a boy was walking out of the bush, wearing dirty pyjamas. His hand outstretched, palm up, staring at him. The boy hooted.</p>
<p>&quot;What the heck is going on?&quot; Jamie said.</p>
<p>He shone the torch around. There were children, boys and girls, about ten, fifteen, he thought, standing at the tree line with arms out stretched. Most of them wore pyjamas, or oversized t-shirts. They were all dirty. And they all had the same, dark, dead pan eyes.</p>
<p>They all began to hoot, whistle and warble like birds. Jamie even recognised some of the sounds, the tui, the bellbird, the morepork.</p>
<p>Jamie got a hold of himself. He stepped forward and spoke, using his adult voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Now I don't know what's going on here, but I want you all to come out of the trees and talk to me right now. No more of this whistling and hooting alright?&quot;</p>
<p>He shone the torch around at the children, they stopped whistling and hooting. The boy in front of him took a few steps forward.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm getting through, Jamie thought.</p>
<p>He stepped towards the boy and placed a hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;Come with me, we'll get this fire goi-&quot;</p>
<p>The boy grabbed his arm and screeched at him, squeezing with the strength of a grown man.</p>
<p>&quot;Now Son,&quot; Jamie said &quot;Let me go and let me help you.&quot;</p>
<p>The boy screeched again and dug his sharp fingernails into Jamie's fore arm. This time it was Jamie who screeched.</p>
<p>&quot;Arggh! Leggo, leggo!&quot; He screamed, clawing at the boys fingers.</p>
<p>The boy dug deeper and blood began to ooze out beneath his finger nails. Jamie could feel it trickle down and drip off his elbow. The rest of the children began whistling and hooting again, louder and louder. Jamie pushed the palm of his free hand against the boy's face, in an attempt to push him away. The boy opened his mouth and bit down hard on his ring finger, harder and harder. Jamie tried to pull away, until suddenly he heard the finger knuckle pop and his hand came free, less half a finger.</p>
<p>The bush was filled with the bird songs of the children and Jamie screaming. He flung the boy around lifting him off the ground. The boy clung to his forearm. Jamie saw the dying embers of the fire behind the boy. He pushed him backwards and held him down in the glowing logs. The boy let go and rolled off the fire, crying out in pain. Jamie ran.</p>
<p>He went straight down the gully, leaving the hoots and warbles of the crazed children behind him. He moved as fast as he could, it was dark and he'd dropped the torch. Supplejack vines tangled his feet and the sharp leaves of native shrubs clawed at his face. His right hand, the one with the missing finger, was inside his swandri and he held the other in front to feel his way. Eventually the bush became so thick he had to crawl, on one hand and two knees. He could hear the children moving slowly down the hill, but gaining on him. He crawled until his head bumped into the trunk of a large tree. He felt his way around it and his hand dropped into a hollow between the tree's roots. He knew this tree, a massive kauri, with a hollow underneath. He rolled into the hollow and tucked his feet in. It smelt of wild boar, moss and damp earth. Maybe the boar he'd killed yesterday had been sleeping here, the one who lay dead in the gully over the ridge, carcass given up to the flies. The circle of life.</p>
<p>Lying in the protective hollow of the centuries old tree, he listened as the children got closer. They were quiet now. He could only hear the sounds of shuffling feet, the odd whistle and the distant chatter of a possum. Twigs cracked underfoot as they started to walk past his hiding place. His heart beat in his ears like the drums in an old explorer movie, the ones with the cannibals. He was worried they could hear it too, these cannibal bird children. Budum... Budum... Budum. One of the children stumbled over a tree root and fell face first into the hollow. The child was so close Jamie could feel its breath on his face, but it was so dark they could not see each other. Jamie held his breath and after what felt like an age, the child warbled and then crawled back up to the others. Jamie let his breath out slowly, ignoring the panic in his lungs.</p>
<p>The children passed without finding him. Then, long after the quiet whistles and shuffling feet had disappeared, Jamie allowed himself to breathe easy and get comfortable. He wanted to inspect his injuries but in the dark it was impossible. Instead he lay with his thoughts, trying to ignore the throbbing aches of his forearm and finger, and listened to the sound of a chattering possum. Jamie normally disliked possums, an introduced pest that needed eradicating and noisy things that kept you up at night. But tonight the possum was his friend, like a familiar face in a crowd of strangers.</p>
<p>Sleep is off the menu tonight anyhow, he thought.</p>
<p>Despite that thought he must have dozed because when he next opened his eyes, a grey light penetrated the dark of the dank hollow. It struck him immediately that something wasn't quite right, the world was missing something, like if the colour blue had disappeared overnight. It was unsettling, almost more so than his missing finger. And the zombie bird children. It dawned on him at the same time the sun did. It was birdsong, or, rather, the lack of it. It was dawn and normally the bush would be alive with bird song. This morning it was silent, save for a gentle dawn breeze. Jamie took it as a good omen, considering the events of the previous night.</p>
<p>He made his way out of the hollow cradling his injured hand inside his swandri. The nub where his finger had been was hot and red but had stopped bleeding. The boy had pulled the finger off right at the knuckle, a clean detachment with no broken bone.</p>
<p>Maybe I should think myself lucky, he thought.</p>
<p>His forearm was bruised and bloody, but the pain was minimal. It looked as though he had a red treasure map tattooed there, complete with location points, where the boys fingernails had broken the skin. It took him a good hour and a half to get back up the gully to the top of the ridge where his gear was. He was worried the children had taken his things, but it seemed they were only interested in muesli bars and biscuits because everything was where he'd left it. His torch lay where he had dropped it, a dim glow emanating from the fading bulb. His pack, utility belt and radio lay untouched on the ground. Next to the cold body of the boy who'd bitten his finger off.</p>
<p>The boy had tried to crawl away. He had only made it a few meters. A fist sized ember was embedded like a black rock in the raw skin of the boys back. Jamie fell to his knees beside the boy. An ugly sob escaped from his lips, it turned into a long moan that echoed like whale song down into the gully below. He turned the boy over and cradled his small body in his arms.</p>
<p>He's so light, Jamie thought, so frail... so young... so young.</p>
<p>Jamie knelt there cradling the boy and crying for hours. When he was done the boy's chest was damp with his tears. He laid the boy under the rocky outcrop and stroked his cheek. The boy looked just like Hemi had at that age. Jamie gathered some fern leaves and covered the boy, before gathering his gear.</p>
<p>The phone had gone flat overnight; Jamie cursed himself for not turning it off. He found his finger by the fire, dirty and shrivelled. He put it in his pocket. He liked having his body all in one place.</p>
<p>He set off along Pine Ridge, the fastest way back to his truck. It was still a long walk and the sun hung high in the sky. He looked around.</p>
<p>No choppers. </p>
<p>He'd expected Search and Rescue to be out scouring the bush by now.</p>
<p>Maybe Mandy never got my text. </p>
<p>He knew she wouldn't be worried about him. It wasn't the first time he'd gone hunting and not made it back till the next day.</p>
<p>The trek along pine ridge was long, but pleasant, all things considered. The sun was warm and his pains were aching less as he walked, although he felt an itch in his phantom finger. He tried scratching the detached finger in his pocket. It didn't work. He walked with the ecstasy only felt by someone who has seen the other side of a traumatic event. The sky was brighter, the air cleaner and he felt a giddy sense of freedom. He imagined this must be how a prisoner felt, walking through the gates of a prison after twenty years of lock up. Or a soldier returning from war.</p>
<p>It was another hour's walk before Jamie heard birdsong. The noise filled the air and made the normally placid bush sound like a rainforest. Jamie sat on a boulder on the side of the track and tried to listen. There was a large group of birds, or children, by the sounds of it, not far to the south. Jamie knew the area, it sounded like they were in an area they called the Rose Bowl, a small clearing where the earth had given way underneath, leaving a bowl shape, like God had stuck a curious finger into the dirt.</p>
<p>I should look, just some recon. he thought.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you doing Jamie, you old fool?&quot; He said to himself.</p>
<p>He made his way off the ridge and down towards the Rose Bowl, quiet as a fantail. The bush was less dense than in the other gully, with older but stunted trees adorned with hanging moss. He took each step carefully, avoiding snapping twigs and crunchy leaves. As he got closer the noise of bird chatter grew into a cacophony of shrieks and whistles and hoots and warbles. He dropped to the ground at the base of a rise that looked down into the Rose Bowl and shimmied his way up. At the top he looked down upon thirty, no, forty odd children standing and laying about aimlessly. He pulled out his binoculars to get a closer look. Some were asleep, draped over each other like sleeping dogs. Others milled around walking nowhere in particular. A group of children sat around a giant heap of berries and nuts, eating handfuls slowly. Nothing much was happening and what was happening happened at a lazy speed. Except for the birds, hundreds of birds of many species flew and hopped around the clearing. It looked organised, in a chaotic way. Some birds hopped around on tree branches, looking this way and that, like security guards. Others flew down and dropped more berries or nuts onto the pile. Jamie was surprised to see a column of Kiwi, in the middle of the day, walking past the pile and adding their contributions.</p>
<p>He scanned around the scene below him, trying to get a measure of the place. The birds all had roles, some were guards, others providing food. A third lot, small birds like fantails and bell birds just flitted about between the children, not doing much. The children did not seem frightened or afraid; it appeared to Jamie as if they were all content, emotionless. No laughter, but no crying either, strange in a group of preteen children this large. Most of the children wore pyjamas, or clothes that they might have slept in, as if they had just got out of bed and walked here.</p>
<p>They probably did, thought Jamie.</p>
<p>He scanned further around. Off in the distance, two or three kilometres away, a flash of red caught Jamie's eye. He used the nob on his binoculars to focus in on the spot. His heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>&quot;No, no, no, no, no&quot; Said Jamie.</p>
<p>At the bottom of a small drop lay Hemi's red quad bike. Jamie mashed his forehead into the dirt.</p>
<p>&quot;No, no, please no&quot;</p>
<p>Jamie lifted his binoculars, focussing again on the Rose Bowl, afraid of what he might see. He looked around the children, at their faces and clothes. He found him sitting by the pile of food. Jamie sighed and dropped the binoculars. He fingered his knife in its sheath and then began crawling on his stomach down into the bowl. He got as close as he could, wary of the strange birds flying overhead. He could see Hemi through the trees, wearing a forest green hunting shirt, his sleeping shirt.</p>
<p>&quot;Hemi&quot; He whispered.</p>
<p>Hemi didn't respond, munching lazily on a mouthful of berries, red juice leaking down his chin.</p>
<p>&quot;Hemi&quot; He called, a bit louder.</p>
<p>A fat wood pigeon, sitting on a thin branch that sagged with his weight, looked in his direction, tilted its head and cooed. A tui and fantail flew over and landed next to the pigeon, straining the branch even more. Jamie lay still. The fantail flew away first, then the tui and then the pigeon went back to bending its branch.</p>
<p>Jamie found a round stone on the ground and threw it at Hemi. It missed and hit one of the other children, who looked up for a second and then reached back into the pile of nuts and berries.</p>
<p>Bugger this, Jamie thought, Bloody birds and children is all. Birds and children.</p>
<p>He stood up, walked straight over to his son and lifted him off the ground, wrapping his calloused hand across his mouth. Hemi struggled as Jamie hauled back into the bush.</p>
<p>&quot;Enough Hemi, it's me, Dad&quot; Jamie said. He hadn't been noticed, no shrieks or whistles.</p>
<p>He had taken three steps into the bush away from the clearing when he heard the growl. He took another step past a large shrub and came face to face with Django and Bitch. Heckles standing on end.</p>
<p>&quot;Django, Bitch, good dogs!&quot; He said while trying to hold Hemi still &quot;Come here, heel&quot;</p>
<p>Django's lip rose showing his vicious teeth. Bitch barked twice. Both dogs started walking forward, snarling.</p>
<p>&quot;Django! Bitch! Heel ya' mongrels&quot; Jamie said, trying to keep his voice low and calm.</p>
<p>The dogs advanced growling louder. Jamie took a step back and both dogs rushed forward. Jamie turned and tried to run, but at the same time Hemi slipped out of his grasp and stumbled back to the clearing. Django bit Jamie on his thigh and Bitch snapped at his ankles. He rammed a heavy boot on Django's head once, twice. On the third stomp the dog let go with a snarl. Jamie kicked the dog hard in the chest and ran back towards the clearing, chased by Bitch, Django limping behind. Jamie ran and vaulted over the pile of food and ran across the clearing towards Hemi. He was blocked by a wall of children, standing around him one hand stretched out. He pulled his knife from its sheath, terror gripping his throat like a vice.</p>
<p>&quot;N-Now come on now, you children stop playing the fool!&quot; He said.</p>
<p>The children advanced, hands stretching out.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't have anything, no more bikkies, no more bars!&quot; He shouted, twirling around &quot;You understand?!&quot;</p>
<p>The children were circling him, closing in.</p>
<p>&quot;Now stop there!&quot; He shouted, waving his knife around.</p>
<p>The first thwack he felt, he thought someone had thrown a rock at his head, until he saw the magpie fluttering of to a tree. The second, he saw coming, but couldn't stop it. The magpie dropped down and snapped at his ear. The third and fourth came in quick succession, two gulls, opening up gashes in his cheek and forehead. The rest came in a flurry, hundreds of birds, beaks and talons. Jamie slashed his knife around, cutting through wings and bodies and necks but the birds kept coming. He tripped over backwards and knocked his head. His knife flew out of his hand and landed spinning around on the ground out of reach. The birds kept coming. He grabbed at them pulling at wings and snapping necks. They pecked at his eyes and ears, all over his face. They tore his clothes off. The group of kiwi came running into the fray and clawed at his body with their feet. He screamed with terror when a magpie pecked through an eyelid. His eye ball popped in its socket gushing juice down the side of his decimated face.</p>
<p>&quot;Hemi!&quot; He screamed &quot;HEMI! Hemi... Hemi...&quot;</p>

<p>Up above the Rose Bowl a Magpie pecked at Jamie's pack, pulling out the mini mag light and the radio. It pecked at the silver buttons on the radio and a voice rung out over Jamie's screams.</p>
<p>&quot;...and what has caused this.&quot; The voice said. An old, thin voice with the hint of a British accent, &quot;But in reality this 'Act of God,' if you believe it as that, is nature sending us a message. And the message is this: our time is up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wow, thank you professor, that was deep&quot; A second voice rang out, trying to sound cherry but failing, &quot;One more question if I may, what do you think we should do? How can we fix this, in your opinion?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We could kill all the birds. It's possible, but what would that achieve? The world as we know it would end. We could, if we had the heart, kill all the children. But even then, what's to stop this playing out again in the next generation? No, all there is left to do is pray, maybe...&quot; He paused, &quot;and be thankful, that mankind gets to live on in our children, in whatever capacity they may live. We must trust them to do a better job than us...&quot;</p>
<p>The Magpie pecked at the radio again and Bob Dylan's voice echoed out across the Rose Bowl,</p>
<p>♪ &quot;...you can't understand. Your sons and your daughters,</p>
<p>are beyond your command. Your old road is rapidly agin'.</p>
<p>Please get out of the new one, if you can't lend your hand</p>
<p>For the times they are a-changin&quot;'. ♪</p>

<p>KUA MUTU</p>
